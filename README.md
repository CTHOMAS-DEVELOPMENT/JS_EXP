# Application to test Javascript, CSS, jQUERY and HTML5 meth (Demo Application)

Includes a Carousel and a (relatively) tiny piece of code for it

# Usage after deployment or viewing demo (Link below)

I took the liberty of adding one extra link to the static menu called 'Javascript knowledge'. 
Please use this link to reveal part 2 of the test. You can toggle between test 1 and test 2 as there are links on both test pages.
